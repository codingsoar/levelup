# Antigravity Work Log

## Logging Rule
- Goal: Keep a portable, append-only record so work can continue in Antigravity.
- Format: Add one entry per request using the fixed template below.
- Update policy: Append a new entry at the end for every new task.
- Required sections: `Request`, `Scope`, `Implemented`, `Validation`, `Files`, `Notes`.

## Entry Template

Copy this block for every new entry:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - Short Task Title

### Request
- What the user asked for.

### Scope
- What area of the codebase was touched.
- What was intentionally out of scope.

### Implemented
- Concrete change 1
- Concrete change 2

### Validation
- `command` -> Success/Failed
- Manual check -> result

### Files
- `path/to/file`
- `path/to/file`

### Notes
- Follow-up risks, assumptions, or handoff details.
```

## Writing Rules
- Keep each section short and factual.
- Prefer exact file paths, commands, and behaviors over narrative summary.
- If validation was blocked, say why explicitly.
- If the task overlaps with concurrent edits, mention that in `Notes`.
- Do not rewrite older entries unless the user explicitly asks.

## 2026-02-19 - Plan Review Request (Tutorial HTML Upload)

### Request
- User requested review/approval of updated `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` for tutorial HTML upload flow.

### Scope
- Review of requested plan documents and related tutorial upload references.
- No code changes were made.

### Implemented
- Searched for `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, `MissionEditorModal`, `htmlContent`, and `tutorial`.
- Confirmed the referenced documents/content were not present in the workspace.
- Provided preliminary architecture guidance based on the described direction.

### Validation
- Manual search -> No matching files or relevant content found in workspace

### Files
- `implementation_plan.md`
- `task.md`

### Notes
- Formal document review was blocked due to missing files.
- Preliminary direction was acceptable: admin upload -> mission `htmlContent` -> student iframe render.
- Requirements called out for implementation:
  - sanitize uploaded HTML before save/render
  - restrict iframe sandbox
  - enforce HTML payload size limit
  - define explicit completion trigger for tutorial missions

---

## 2026-02-19 - Implementation (Antigravity Continuation)

### Request
- Continue implementation from Antigravity context.
- Add tutorial HTML upload in admin flow and render it for students in mission view.

### Scope
- Admin mission editor tutorial upload flow.
- Student mission rendering for tutorial HTML content.

### Implemented
- Extended `MissionEditorModal` in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` with `htmlContent` and `htmlFileName`.
- Added tutorial HTML upload input for `type === 'tutorial'`.
- Implemented file read via `file.text()` and mission payload binding.
- Added 1 MB size guard with `MAX_TUTORIAL_HTML_BYTES`.
- Added upload error feedback and loaded file summary text.
- Updated `TutorialView` in `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` to render `mission.htmlContent` with `iframe srcDoc`.
- Added `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups"` for tutorial HTML iframe rendering.
- Added completion checkbox and complete button for HTML tutorial mode.
- Kept existing `tutorialSteps` flow as fallback.
- Updated main mission render routing to use `mission.type` first with difficulty fallback.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` -> Partial success
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx`

### Notes
- Feature path is now connected end-to-end for tutorial HTML missions.
- `src/pages/MissionPage.jsx` had no new lint errors from this change.
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` still had pre-existing issues:
  - `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
  - `no-unused-vars` (`submissions`)
  - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning
- Existing repo-wide lint debt remained unresolved and unrelated to this feature.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Calendar

### Request
- Show lesson sessions on the admin dashboard calendar for the dates they were created.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar rendering only.
- Assessment session storage behavior remained unchanged.

### Implemented
- Wired `useAssessmentStore(state => state.sessionScores)` into the admin dashboard flow in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Built date-keyed calendar data from `sessionScores`.
- Deduplicated session entries by `courseId + sessionDate + sessionLabel` because sessions are stored per assessment area.
- Passed aggregated session data into `DashboardCalendar`.
- Replaced mock calendar data with prop-based input in `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`.
- Rendered per-date session count and up to two session labels in each day cell.
- Added selected-date detail panel listing all sessions for that date with course title.
- Cleared selected state if the underlying date data disappears.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM` during Vite config resolution, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- This task overlapped with other concurrent changes already present in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- This change affects admin dashboard visibility only; assessment session storage behavior was not changed.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Calendar Layout Cleanup

### Request
- Show the course name for each session on the admin dashboard calendar.
- Keep session items inside each date cell without overflowing.
- Improve alignment and allow the calendar to be larger if needed.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar UI only.
- No changes to session aggregation or assessment storage behavior.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` date-cell layout to use taller fixed-height cells.
- Added compact session preview cards with `courseTitle` on the first line and session label on the second line.
- Added per-day count badge in the cell header.
- Limited in-cell preview to two items plus an overflow summary.
- Kept selected-date detail panel and reordered its content to show course first, then session label.
- Updated calendar heading copy to match the new session-focused behavior.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten as a whole to avoid patch drift from mixed text encoding in the previous file content.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Width Expansion

### Request
- Move the course progress panel below the calendar.
- Make the calendar wider horizontally so text in date cells is less likely to be clipped.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard overview layout only.
- No changes to calendar data generation.

### Implemented
- Removed the side-by-side calendar/progress layout in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Placed `DashboardCalendar` in its own full-width block.
- Moved the course progress card below the calendar.
- Expanded the dashboard overview container from `max-w-7xl` to full width.
- Changed the course progress card body to a responsive grid so it still uses space efficiently after moving below the calendar.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- This was a layout-only change to create more horizontal room for date-cell content.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Layout Structure Fix

### Request
- Re-check the dashboard because the course progress panel had not actually moved below the calendar.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard overview JSX structure only.
- No visual redesign beyond correcting the broken layout nesting.

### Implemented
- Restored the missing closing wrapper for the top statistics grid in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Removed the extra closing wrapper after the course progress section.
- Kept the intended layout: full-width calendar first, course progress card below it.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- The previous change had left the stats grid wrapper unclosed, which caused the layout to render differently from the intended structure.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Cell Scrolling

### Request
- Allow scrolling inside a date cell when many sessions are assigned to the same date.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar cell rendering only.
- No changes to dashboard layout or session aggregation.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` so each date cell keeps a fixed height while the session list area scrolls vertically.
- Increased the day-cell height slightly to create more room for the in-cell list.
- Changed the cell content from preview-plus-summary to a full in-cell scrollable list of sessions.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten again to avoid patch instability caused by mixed text encoding in the previous version.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Course Icons

### Request
- Replace in-cell course text with course icons so date cells can show session labels more compactly.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar session display only.
- No changes to session storage or dashboard layout.

### Implemented
- Added `courseIcon` into the aggregated session calendar data in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Used the course icon from course metadata, with `📚` as fallback.
- Updated `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` so date cells show `icon + session label` instead of course name text.
- Kept the selected-date detail panel showing both course icon and course title for clarity.
- Replaced the in-cell scroll list with a compact preview of up to four sessions plus an overflow count.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten to normalize prior mixed text content and make the compact icon-based layout deterministic.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Calendar Pill Layout

### Request
- Show sessions inside date cells as compact button-like items sized to their text, instead of full-row blocks.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard calendar cell UI only.
- No changes to aggregated session data structure.

### Implemented
- Reworked `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx` session preview items into compact rounded pills.
- Changed the in-cell session container to a wrapping layout so pills flow naturally across the available width.
- Increased the visible item cap in the cell to six pills before showing an overflow counter.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/components/DashboardCalendar.jsx`

### Notes
- The calendar component was rewritten again to keep the compact pill layout deterministic and avoid patch drift.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Admin Dashboard Session Ordering

### Request
- Sort sessions in the calendar in natural lesson order.

### Scope
- Admin dashboard session aggregation sort order only.
- No UI structure changes.

### Implemented
- Updated `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` calendar session sort comparator to use Korean natural string ordering with numeric comparison.
- Added course-title fallback ordering when labels are identical.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> sandbox failed with `spawn EPERM`, escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`

### Notes
- This makes labels like `1차시, 2차시, 10차시` render in expected numeric order instead of pure lexical order.

---

## 2026-03-12 - Badge/Achievement System

### Request
- Implement a comprehensive badge/achievement system (100 badges) for students.

### Scope
- Created badge definitions and conditions.
- Implemented global badge checking store and notification UI.
- Integrated badge collection UI into `StudentProfilePage` and `AdminPage`.
- Fixed CSS `@import` build error.

### Implemented
- Added `src/data/badgesData.js` with 100 badge definitions and `condition(stats)` functions.
- Added `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js` to manage unlocked badges, calculate aggregated `stats`, and trigger checks.
- Added `src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx` to show animated toast popups upon unlocking via `badgeUnlocked` CustomEvent.
- Added `<BadgeNotification />` to global routing layout in `src/App.jsx`.
- Added "My Badges" section in `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`.
- Added "View Badges" modal in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` (Learners Management) for admins to inspect student achievements.
- Moved `@import url(...)` before `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/index.css` to fix Vite build error.

### Validation
- Vite dev server -> Success, application loads without white screen.
- UI -> Admin badge modal and student profile badge grids render correctly.

### Files
- `src/data/badgesData.js`
- `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js`
- `src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/index.css`

### Notes
- Badge unlocking relies on evaluating `progress`, `sessions`, `purchases` globally from `useBadgeStore.getState().checkBadges()`, triggered by `BadgeNotification`'s `useEffect` listener to other stores.
- Built compatibly with Codex's concurrent modifications to `AdminPage.jsx` (Session Calendar).

---

## 2026-03-12 - Push Current Workspace Changes

### Request
- Push the current workspace changes to the remote repository.

### Scope
- Repository state management and remote sync only.
- No new product behavior changes beyond recording the push task in the worklog.

### Implemented
- Reviewed `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md` and current `git status` before sync.
- Prepared the current workspace changes for commit and push.

### Validation
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success
- `git push` -> Pending

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Commit and push details will match the final synced workspace state for this task.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Sub-Admin Full Admin Access

### Request
- Allow sub-admin accounts created from the sub-admin tab to use the admin dashboard and the same major admin areas as the main admin.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` admin UI access and sub-admin account management flow.
- No auth route changes were needed because `/admin` already allowed `subadmin`.

### Implemented
- Added a working `SubAdminManagement` view to create, edit, and delete sub-admin accounts.
- Changed the admin sidebar so `subadmin` users can access `Dashboard`, `Learners`, `Class`, `Assessments`, `Marketplace`, `Sub-Admin`, and `Settings`.
- Changed admin page initial view to `dashboard` for sub-admin logins as well.
- Assigned all current course IDs when creating or updating a sub-admin account for compatibility with existing stored course metadata.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success
- Production build -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- `AdminPage.jsx` contains existing mixed text encoding in older strings; new logic was added without broad text normalization to avoid unrelated churn.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Login Page Cross-Link Removal

### Request
- Remove the link from the student login page to the admin login page.
- Remove the link from the admin login page to the student login page.

### Scope
- Login page UI only.
- Direct route access to `/` and `/admin-login` remained unchanged.

### Implemented
- Removed the footer login-switch button from `StudentLoginPage`.
- Removed the footer login-switch button from `AdminLoginPage`.
- Removed the unused `Button` import from `AdminLoginPage`.

### Validation
- Manual code check -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentLoginPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminLoginPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Users can still access each login page directly by URL; only the in-page shortcut links were removed.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Sub-Admin Permission Controls

### Request
- Let the main admin configure each sub-admin's permissions from the sub-admin tab.

### Scope
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js` sub-admin persistence/login payload.
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` sub-admin management UI and sub-admin admin-page access control.

### Implemented
- Added per-sub-admin `permissions` storage with defaults for `dashboard`, `learners`, `class`, `assessments`, `marketplace`, `subadmins`, and `settings`.
- Included sub-admin permissions in login state and persistence migration.
- Added permission checkboxes to the sub-admin create/edit modal.
- Updated the sub-admin list to display the currently enabled permission badges.
- Restricted admin sidebar tabs for logged-in sub-admins based on their saved permissions and auto-fallback to the first allowed view.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Existing sub-admin accounts are migrated to full access by default unless specific permissions are later turned off by the main admin.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Student Reflection Tab

### Request
- Add an English `Reflection` tab on the student page.
- Let students review which class/stage their own reflection sentence was saved under.

### Scope
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js` reflection persistence.
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` student mission completion and reflection tab UI.
- No admin-facing reflection UI was added.

### Implemented
- Added persisted `reflections` storage and `getStudentReflections(studentId)` in the progress store.
- Extended mission completion to optionally save one reflection sentence with course/stage/mission metadata.
- Added a reflection input modal during first-time mission completion.
- Added a `Reflection` sidebar tab on the student page.
- Added a reflection list view showing the student's own saved entries with course, stage, difficulty, and timestamp.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Reflection entries are created only on first-time mission completion and displayed newest first.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Reflection UI Alignment + Save Fix

### Request
- Make the student `Reflection` tab match the surrounding student-page UI.
- Check and fix the error that occurs when writing a reflection.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` reflection tab presentation only.
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js` reflection persistence safety/migration.

### Implemented
- Added a reflection count badge to the student sidebar tab.
- Restyled the reflection page into summary card + reflection cards consistent with the existing dashboard card system.
- Hardened reflection persistence by defaulting missing legacy `reflections` arrays during save/read.
- Added a persist migration so older saved progress state upgrades cleanly to include `reflections`.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The likely runtime failure was legacy persisted progress data missing the `reflections` array; save/read paths now guard against that case.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Reflection Modal State Cleanup

### Request
- Fix the problem in the reflection modal shown after finishing a stage.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` reflection modal state handling only.
- No persistence or admin-side changes.

### Implemented
- Added a dedicated `closeReflectionModal` handler to reset modal visibility, text, and validation state together.
- Reused that handler for both cancel/close and successful save paths.
- Prevented stale reflection text or error state from remaining when the modal is reopened.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- This change was applied on top of the in-progress student reflection feature changes already present in the workspace.

---

## 2026-03-13 - Reflection Input Focus Fix

### Request
- Fix the reflection modal so typing does not flicker or drop input.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` reflection modal rendering only.
- No store or route changes.

### Implemented
- Removed the inline nested `ReflectionInputModal` component definition from inside `StudentDashboardPage`.
- Rendered the reflection modal directly in the page JSX so the textarea no longer remounts on each keystroke.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Root cause was component identity churn causing the modal subtree to remount during controlled textarea updates.

## 2026-03-13 - Admin Help Guide Modal

### Request
- Make the admin page `?` button open a popup guide that explains how to use the full admin page for first-time users.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` top-header help action and admin help UI only.
- No changes to admin data models or existing management flows.

### Implemented
- Added `AdminHelpModal` to `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`.
- Connected the top-right help button to open the modal.
- Wrote beginner-focused guide content covering quick start steps, menu-by-menu usage, and operating tips.
- Filtered guide sections by the current account's visible admin permissions and highlighted the current page.

### Validation
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The help modal uses the existing admin visual style and closes by overlay click, close button, or `Escape`.

## 2026-03-13 - Student/Admin Stability Optimization

### Request
- Review the codebase and optimize the unstable parts found during inspection.

### Scope
- Student notification header, student assessments page, badge notification flow, badge stats calculation, and notification store migration.
- No broad cleanup of existing admin-page lint debt beyond this focused stability pass.

### Implemented
- Removed React Compiler-fragile memoization from the student notification header and added safe handling for legacy notifications missing `readBy`.
- Changed the student assessments page to derive the active course from current assignments instead of relying on one-time initial state.
- Reconnected badge recalculation to `sessionScores` instead of the removed `sessions` field.
- Reworked badge assessment stats to use current assessment-plan/session-score structures.
- Added notification-store migration to normalize persisted `readBy` arrays.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/components/StudentHeaderActions.jsx src/pages/StudentAssessmentsPage.jsx src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx src/stores/useBadgeStore.js src/stores/useNotificationStore.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success
- `npx eslint src` -> Failed (remaining pre-existing issues in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`, `src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx`, `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`, `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`)

### Files
- `src/components/StudentHeaderActions.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentAssessmentsPage.jsx`
- `src/components/BadgeNotification.jsx`
- `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js`
- `src/stores/useNotificationStore.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Remaining repo-wide lint failures are now concentrated outside the files changed in this optimization pass, with `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` still the largest source of debt.

## 2026-03-13 - Repo Lint Cleanup

### Request
- Continue the optimization pass and clean up the remaining lint issues across the repository.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`, `src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx`, `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`, and `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`.
- No feature redesign beyond making existing flows lint-safe and compile-clean.

### Implemented
- Removed unused imports/state in admin, marketplace, and student profile pages.
- Reworked `MissionEditorModal` initialization in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` to use derived initial state plus remount-by-key instead of effect-driven synchronous state resets.
- Kept the existing admin help modal wiring and made the admin page fully lint-clean.
- Fixed student dashboard hook dependency warnings.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Build still reports a large bundle-size warning only; lint and compile errors are resolved.

## 2026-03-13 - Route-Based Bundle Splitting

### Request
- Reduce the bundle-size warning and verify the optimization still works correctly.

### Scope
- `src/App.jsx` routing/loading behavior.
- `vite.config.js` build chunking configuration.

### Implemented
- Changed top-level page imports in `src/App.jsx` to `React.lazy(...)`.
- Wrapped route rendering in `Suspense` with a lightweight loading fallback.
- Added Vite `manualChunks` rules to split `xlsx`, UI libraries, Zustand, and remaining vendor code.
- Removed an unnecessary `router` manual chunk after it generated an empty chunk warning.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/App.jsx vite.config.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success
- Build output check -> Success, route/page chunks generated separately and previous `>500 kB` warning no longer appears

### Files
- `src/App.jsx`
- `vite.config.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Final build produced separate chunks such as `AdminPage`, `StudentDashboardPage`, `MarketplacePage`, `StudentProfilePage`, `ui`, `vendor`, and `xlsx`.

## 2026-03-15 - Admin Reflection Overview

### Request
- Let admins view the student-page `Reflection` content.
- Add an admin `Reflection` tab that shows enrolled students' reflection sentences grouped by course.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` admin navigation and reflection overview UI.
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js` sub-admin permission defaults.
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js` reflection selectors.

### Implemented
- Added `reflection` as an admin/sub-admin permission and sidebar view.
- Added an admin `ReflectionManagement` view with per-course selection, summary counts, and student-grouped reflection cards.
- Wired admin data access to persisted reflection entries and added reusable course/all reflection selectors in the progress store.
- Extended the admin help modal guide to describe the new reflection workflow.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/stores/useAuthStore.js src/stores/useProgressStore.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Existing sub-admin accounts migrate to include `reflection: true` by default through the shared permission normalizer.
- Admin reflection visibility is read-only; no edit/delete flow was added for reflection entries.

## 2026-03-15 - Student Assigned Class Filtering Fix

### Request
- Check why student `3101` could see classes without being enrolled.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` student dashboard and class-list rendering only.
- No auth data model change was needed.

### Implemented
- Derived `myCourses` from `user.courseIds` and changed the student dashboard to render assigned classes only.
- Updated course count cards, shortcut cards, and `My Class` list to use `myCourses` instead of all courses.
- Restricted `openCourse` query handling so students cannot open an unassigned class by URL parameter.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- `src/components/StudentLayout.jsx` already filtered sidebar class counts by `courseIds`; the bug was limited to the main student dashboard page content.

## 2026-03-15 - Default Admin Password Change

### Request
- Allow the default admin account to change its password from the `Settings` tab.

### Scope
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js` default admin credential persistence and update action.
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` settings UI for password change.

### Implemented
- Added persisted `adminCredentials` state with migration fallback to the default `admin / admin1234` account.
- Changed default admin login to use persisted credentials instead of a hardcoded password only.
- Added `changeAdminPassword(currentPassword, newPassword)` to the auth store.
- Added a main-admin-only password change form in `Settings` with current password check, confirmation check, and inline success/error feedback.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/stores/useAuthStore.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The new settings form changes only the default `admin` account password; sub-admin password management remains in the existing sub-admin management flow.

## 2026-03-15 - Interface Theme Separation

### Request
- Make light mode and dark mode apply as clearly separated interface themes.

### Scope
- `src/index.css` shared theme overrides.
- `src/components/StudentLayout.jsx`, `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`, and `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` root theme shell wiring.

### Implemented
- Added `student-theme-light/dark` and `admin-theme-light/dark` shell classes to the main student/admin app wrappers.
- Added scoped CSS overrides so dark-mode student screens switch card, border, text, and input colors away from the previous light-only palette.
- Added scoped CSS overrides so light-mode admin screens stop rendering as always-dark and use brighter surfaces/text.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx src/components/StudentLayout.jsx` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/index.css`
- `src/components/StudentLayout.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The change is implemented as scoped CSS theme-shell overrides so existing page structures remain intact without large JSX churn across every screen.

## 2026-03-15 - Admin Reflection Light Mode Contrast

### Request
- In admin `Reflection`, make the student-written sentence easier to read in light mode by using a color similar to surrounding text.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` reflection-entry text color only.
- No reflection data or layout changes.

### Implemented
- Changed the reflection body text class from `text-gray-100` to `text-gray-300` in the admin reflection card content.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- This specifically improves the light-mode contrast inside the admin reflection cards while keeping dark-mode styling compatible with the existing theme-shell overrides.

## 2026-03-15 - Admin Course Progress Detail View

### Request
- Let admins check student progress for each class.
- It could be a new tab or entered by clicking the per-course progress block on the dashboard.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` dashboard course-progress block and a new course progress detail view.
- No progress data model changes were required.

### Implemented
- Made the dashboard per-course progress cards clickable.
- Added `CourseProgressManagement` in the admin page, opened from the dashboard and filtered by selected course.
- Added per-course summary cards for enrolled students, average progress, and fully completed students.
- Added per-student rows with mission completion percentage, completed stages count, and stage-by-stage completion chips.
- Restricted the detail view to accessible courses for sub-admins.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The course progress detail view is currently an internal admin view entered from the dashboard course-progress section, not a dedicated sidebar menu item.

## 2026-03-15 - Course Progress Dropdown Theme Fix

### Request
- In `Course Progress`, make the course selection dropdown readable in both light and dark themes.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` course-progress course selector only.
- No data or layout changes beyond dropdown theming.

### Implemented
- Wired `CourseProgressManagement` to the current theme state.
- Changed the course `<select>` and `<option>` styles to use light text/background in dark mode and dark text/background in light mode.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The fix is localized to the admin course-progress selector and does not change other admin dropdowns.

## 2026-03-12 - Fix Unassigned Class Visibility Bug

### Request
- 특정 class에 등록하지 않은 학생으로 로그인했을 때 모든 class가 보이는 버그 수정.

### Scope
- src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx

### Files
- src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx

### Notes
- None.

## 2026-03-15 - Learners Dropdown Theme Fix

### Request
- In the admin `Learners` tab, make the dropdown readable in light mode instead of rendering as black.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` learners filter dropdown styling only.
- No data, filtering behavior, or layout changes.

### Implemented
- Wired `LearnersManagement` to the current theme state.
- Updated the `Year` and `Grade` `<select>` controls to use light-mode and dark-mode specific text/background/border styles.
- Updated the dropdown `<option>` styles so opened menus remain readable in both themes.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The fix mirrors the earlier `Course Progress` dropdown theme handling to keep admin select styling consistent.

## 2026-03-15 - Reflection Dropdown Theme Fix

### Request
- In the admin `Reflection` tab, make the course dropdown readable in both light and dark themes.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` reflection course selector styling only.
- No reflection data or layout changes.

### Implemented
- Wired `ReflectionManagement` to the current theme state.
- Updated the reflection course `<select>` to use theme-specific border, background, and text colors.
- Updated the dropdown `<option>` styles so the opened menu remains readable in light mode as well.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The reflection selector now follows the same theme-handling pattern as the admin `Course Progress` and `Learners` dropdowns.

## 2026-03-15 - Reflection Modal Contrast Fix

### Request
- Make the popup shown when writing a reflection easier to read.
- Change the popup text to black and add visible line borders.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` student reflection modal styling only.
- No reflection save logic or flow changes.

### Implemented
- Added a visible border and white background styling to the reflection modal container.
- Changed the modal helper text and counter text to darker slate colors for readability.
- Strengthened the textarea border and changed the input text/placeholder contrast for clearer separation.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The update targets the mission-completion reflection popup shown on the student page.

## 2026-03-15 - Video Quiz Action Button Contrast Fix

### Request
- In `video&quiz` stages, make the `Submit` and `Claim Star` text readable under the current theme.

### Scope
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` video/quiz mission action button styling only.
- No quiz logic or completion rules changed.

### Implemented
- Added explicit readable text/background styling to the `Take Quiz`, `Complete Mission`, `Next`, `Submit`, `Claim Star`, and `Restart Quiz` buttons in `VideoView`.
- Kept button states and handlers unchanged while preventing theme-dependent text visibility issues.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The fix is localized to the student `VideoView` mission flow where HeroUI button defaults were not consistently readable across themes.

### Request
- ������ ������ settings�� `System Preferences` ��Ͽ��� `Notifications` �׸� ����.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` settings UI only.
- Notification store/header behavior was not changed.

### Implemented
- Removed the `Notifications` coming-soon card from the `System Preferences` section.

### Validation
- `git diff -- src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Change is limited to the settings page card list; existing admin notification features remain intact.
## 2026-03-15 - Learners Table Light Mode Border Contrast

### Request
- ����Ʈ����� �� learners �� ���̺��� �׵θ��� ������ �� �Ǵ� ���� ����.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` learners table styling only.
- No data or behavior changes.

### Implemented
- Added theme-aware border, header background, row divider, and hover colors for the learners table.
- Adjusted learner row text colors in light mode to match the stronger table contrast.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Dark mode styling was kept intact; only light-mode contrast was strengthened.
## 2026-03-15 - Admin Light Mode Border Consistency

### Request
- �ٸ� �ǿ��� �׵θ��� �ִ� �κ��� ����Ʈ��忡�� �����ϰ� ���̵��� ����.

### Scope
- `src/index.css` admin light-theme border/divider overrides.
- Existing learners-specific table refinement in `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` remained in place.

### Implemented
- Strengthened `admin-theme-light` overrides for `border-white/5`, `border-white/10`, and `border-white/20`.
- Added matching `divide-white/5`, `divide-white/10`, and `divide-white/20` overrides so table/list separators are also visible across admin tabs.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success
- `git diff -- src/index.css src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/index.css`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- This change applies broadly to the admin page in light mode without altering dark mode styling.
## 2026-03-15 - Class and Marketplace Light Mode Border Check

### Request
- `class` �ǰ� `marketplace` ���� �׵θ� ���� ���� �� ����.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` class/course editor and marketplace list/table containers.
- Existing global light-mode border overrides in `src/index.css` remained in place.

### Implemented
- Added light-mode border/header/row hover styling for the class list table.
- Added light-mode border styling for course-editor stage cards, mission cards, and enrolled-student table.
- Added light-mode border/list styling for marketplace items table and pending/delivered order lists.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success
- `git diff -- src/pages/AdminPage.jsx src/index.css` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/index.css`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Dark mode styling was preserved; the updates target light-mode visibility and separation only.
## 2026-03-15 - Assessments Area Edit Modal Light Mode Fix

### Request
- ����Ʈ��忡�� Assessments�� ������ ���� ���� UI�� ��ũ���ó�� ���̴� ���� Ȯ�� �� ����.

### Scope
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` assessments area edit modal and related scoring modal theme styling.
- No scoring logic or data model changes.

### Implemented
- Added `isDark` theme awareness to `AssessmentsManagement`.
- Replaced hardcoded dark modal backgrounds in the area-edit modal with theme-aware modal container styles.
- Updated the area-edit modal inputs/cards to use light-mode backgrounds and borders when the admin page is in light mode.
- Applied the same theme-aware modal container/input treatment to the scoring session modal because it used the same hardcoded dark pattern.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success
- `git diff -- src/pages/AdminPage.jsx` -> Success

### Files
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The reported issue was caused by `bg-[#1e1e2e]` and dark-only input styles inside assessments modals.

## 2026-03-16 - Push Workspace To StarQuest

### Request
- Push the current workspace to `https://github.com/codingsoar/starquest.git`.

### Scope
- Repository sync and current untracked backend files only.
- No frontend behavior changes beyond including the existing `server/` workspace.

### Implemented
- Reviewed the shared worklog and current git state before syncing.
- Added the current `server/` backend files to version control.
- Prepared the repository for push to the StarQuest remote.

### Validation
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success
- `git remote -v` -> Success

### Files
- `server/database.js`
- `server/package.json`
- `server/package-lock.json`
- `server/server.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- `server/node_modules` remained untracked because the repo-level `node_modules` ignore rule already covers nested dependency folders.

## 2026-03-16 - Switch GitHub Login To aidskaan And Push

### Request
- Re-login for GitHub pushes and permanently switch the machine identity from `techitsoar` to `aidskaan`.
- Push the current branch to `https://github.com/codingsoar/starquest.git`.

### Scope
- Git identity, cached GitHub credentials, remote URL normalization, and repository push.
- No product code changes beyond worklog updates.

### Implemented
- Updated global Git `user.name` to `aidskaan`.
- Normalized `origin` URL to remove the old embedded username.
- Removed the old cached `techitsoar` GitHub login and ran a fresh Git Credential Manager login for `aidskaan`.
- Pushed `main` to `https://github.com/codingsoar/starquest.git` successfully.

### Validation
- `git config --get --global user.name` -> Success (`aidskaan`)
- `git push https://github.com/codingsoar/starquest.git main:main` -> Success

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The existing commit `608955a` was pushed first; this worklog follow-up is being recorded afterward for future handoff continuity.

## 2026-03-16 - Admin Login Failure Diagnosis And Fix

### Request
- Check why the admin account could not log in.

### Scope
- Admin/student login flow in the auth store and login pages.
- Server-side SQLite initialization for the default admin account.

### Implemented
- Identified two causes: async login functions were being called synchronously in the login pages, and the server DB did not seed a default `admin` user.
- Updated `AdminLoginPage` and `StudentLoginPage` to await login results and show a temporary submitting state.
- Updated `useAuthStore` login functions to fall back to local persisted admin/student data if the API is unavailable or does not authenticate.
- Added default admin seeding in `server/database.js` with `INSERT OR IGNORE` for `admin / admin1234`.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src\stores\useAuthStore.js src\pages\AdminLoginPage.jsx src\pages\StudentLoginPage.jsx` -> Success
- `node -` SQLite check for `admin` user -> Success

### Files
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/pages/AdminLoginPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentLoginPage.jsx`
- `server/database.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- There were already unrelated in-progress edits in several files, including `src/stores/useAuthStore.js` and `src/pages/StudentLoginPage.jsx`; the fix was limited to the login path.
- Changes were not committed or pushed in this task.

## 2026-03-16 - Resume Interrupted Server Sync Work

### Request
- Recover the interrupted Antigravity work and finish it safely.

### Scope
- Frontend/server progress sync, admin dashboard server data loading, local API proxying, and deployment helper files.
- Excluded committing the generated SQLite database file.

### Implemented
- Completed the in-progress server sync path across `useProgressStore`, `StudentDashboardPage`, `AdminPage`, `server/server.js`, and `vite.config.js`.
- Changed auth-store student syncing to merge server data with existing local metadata instead of overwriting it.
- Normalized reflection payloads and persisted reflection titles in SQLite so admin/student reflection UIs keep working after reloads.
- Kept local mission completion working as a fallback when the backend is unavailable.
- Added `server/database.sqlite` to `.gitignore` and kept the deployment helper files `server/ecosystem.config.js` and `server/nginx.conf.example` as part of the workspace.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src\stores\useAuthStore.js src\stores\useProgressStore.js src\pages\AdminPage.jsx src\pages\StudentDashboardPage.jsx src\pages\AdminLoginPage.jsx src\pages\StudentLoginPage.jsx vite.config.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Success

### Files
- `.gitignore`
- `server/database.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `server/ecosystem.config.js`
- `server/nginx.conf.example`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `vite.config.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The generated local database file `server/database.sqlite` is intentionally ignored and was not prepared for commit.
- A one-off Node validation script closed SQLite before async schema checks finished; runtime server usage is unaffected because the server process keeps the DB open.

## 2026-03-16 - Push Current Main To LevelUp

### Request
- Push the current repository state to `https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git`.
- Summarize the Ubuntu deployment procedure.

### Scope
- Repository sync to an additional GitHub remote and deployment handoff notes.
- No product code changes.

### Implemented
- Verified the current `main` branch state before sync.
- Prepared the current branch for push to the LevelUp repository.
- Documented the deployment handoff request for future sessions.

### Validation
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success
- `git ls-remote https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git` -> Success

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Push target for this task is `codingsoar/levelup` rather than the existing origin remote.

## 2026-03-16 - Block Auto-Creation Of Student Accounts

### Request
- Prevent arbitrary student IDs from being auto-created at the student login screen.
- Require students to be added by an admin before they can log in.

### Scope
- Server auth/student management APIs and frontend auth-store student sync.
- No UI redesign beyond preserving the existing login flow.

### Implemented
- Removed the server-side fallback that auto-created missing student accounts during `/api/auth/login`.
- Added server-side student upsert/delete APIs so admin-created students are persisted to SQLite.
- Added user schema fields for student `grade` and `admission_year`, plus migrations for older DBs.
- Updated frontend student-related auth-store actions to sync create/update/delete/password/course changes to the server.
- Changed login fallback behavior so rejected server auth no longer silently falls back to local data unless the request itself fails.

### Validation
- `node --check server/server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server/database.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Success

### Files
- `server/database.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The server lint command reported `no-undef` for Node globals because the repo ESLint config targets browser code; Node syntax validation was used for backend files instead.

## 2026-03-17 - Repository Analysis Snapshot

### Request
- Analyze the current project in this folder and explain its structure and state.

### Scope
- Repository-wide read-only analysis of frontend, backend, stores, and runtime health.
- No product behavior changes were made.

### Implemented
- Reviewed the shared worklog and current repository status before analysis.
- Inspected app routing, key Zustand stores, sample course data, admin/student pages, marketplace, assessments, and Express/SQLite server files.
- Verified current runtime health with frontend build attempt and backend syntax checks.

### Validation
- `git status --short` -> Success (clean working tree)
- `npm run build` -> Failed in sandbox (`spawn EPERM` while loading Vite config)
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success

### Files
- `package.json`
- `vite.config.js`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `src/stores/useStageStore.js`
- `src/stores/useAssessmentStore.js`
- `src/stores/useMarketplaceStore.js`
- `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js`
- `src/pages/StudentDashboardPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx`
- `src/data/sampleCourses.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `server/database.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The repo is a Vite/React student-learning platform with Zustand persistence plus an Express/SQLite backend for auth and progress sync.
- `README.md` is still template-level and does not document the actual project.
- Multiple source files contain mojibake/mixed text encoding in Korean strings; functionality appears intact, but text maintenance is riskier in those files.

## 2026-03-17 - Functional Audit Snapshot

### Request
- Check whether the implemented features are fully functional across the current project.

### Scope
- Repository-wide validation covering frontend build/lint, backend syntax, live API checks, and code-path review for critical student/admin flows.
- No product behavior changes were made.

### Implemented
- Re-ran repository state checks before auditing.
- Ran ESLint, frontend production build, and backend syntax validation.
- Started the local server and exercised auth, student upsert/delete, mission completion, progress fetch, and admin dashboard APIs.
- Reviewed critical frontend integration points for logout, progress sync, and student/admin data usage.

### Validation
- `git status --short` -> Modified: `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`
- `npm run lint` -> Failed (server files use browser-focused ESLint globals)
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- Live API audit -> Found reproducible issues in mission-complete consistency and duplicate star awarding

### Files
- `src/components/StudentLayout.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The project is not currently in a state where all implemented features can be called fully reliable.
- Verified defects include: stale immediate progress reads after completion, duplicate star awards on repeated completion API calls, incomplete logout behavior from `StudentLayout`, and student-profile course stats using all courses instead of assigned courses.
- Admin dashboard syncing also appears non-authoritative because server-loaded students are merged with local leftovers rather than replaced.

## 2026-03-17 - Fix Functional Audit Findings

### Request
- Fix the verified functional issues and validate the fixes again.

### Scope
- Mission completion consistency on the backend.
- Student logout, student-profile course filtering, and admin student sync on the frontend/store.
- No unrelated UI redesign or feature expansion.

### Implemented
- Changed `/api/progress/complete` to check existing completion first, avoid duplicate star awards, and wait for DB callbacks before returning success.
- Added `alreadyCompleted` handling in `useProgressStore` so client state does not add stars again if the server reports a duplicate completion.
- Fixed shared student-layout logout to call `logout()` before navigation.
- Limited `StudentProfilePage` progress stats to assigned courses only.
- Changed `useAuthStore.setAllStudents` to replace the admin student list with server data instead of merging stale local leftovers.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src\components\StudentLayout.jsx src\pages\StudentProfilePage.jsx src\stores\useAuthStore.js src\stores\useProgressStore.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success
- Live API regression test -> Success (immediate progress read returned stars/reflection, duplicate completion did not increase stars)

### Files
- `server/server.js`
- `src/components/StudentLayout.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentProfilePage.jsx`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Repo-wide `npm run lint` still reports Node-global issues in `server/` because the current ESLint config is browser-oriented; this is a tooling/config gap, not a regression from these fixes.

## 2026-03-17 - Lint Split And Ubuntu Deployment Assets

### Request
- Split ESLint so repo-wide lint works for both frontend and backend.
- Then add Ubuntu deployment documentation, PM2/Nginx config, server start scripts, and a deployment checklist.

### Scope
- Tooling/config only plus deployment documentation/assets.
- No product feature behavior changes beyond keeping the repo build/lint healthy.

### Implemented
- Split `eslint.config.js` into frontend React/browser rules and backend Node/CommonJS rules.
- Replaced the template `README.md` with a project-specific overview and deployment entry points.
- Added `DEPLOY_UBUNTU.md` with package install steps, build/start commands, Nginx setup, update flow, and a deployment checklist.
- Rewrote `server/ecosystem.config.js` as a production-focused PM2 config for `/var/www/starquest/server`.
- Replaced `server/nginx.conf.example` with a clean Ubuntu/Nginx reverse-proxy config for SPA + `/api`.
- Added `server/start-prod.sh` and `server/restart-prod.sh` for first boot and update/reload flows.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` -> Success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\ecosystem.config.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Sandbox failed (`spawn EPERM`), escalated success

- `server/nginx.conf.example`
- `server/start-prod.sh`

### Notes
- The PM2 and Nginx configs assume deployment under `/var/www/starquest`; change that path in docs/config if the server uses a different location.
- The shell scripts are intended for Ubuntu/Linux and should be made executable on the server with `chmod +x` after deploy.

## 2026-03-17 - Push Current Main To LevelUp

### Request
- Push the current repository state to `https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git`.

### Scope
- Repository sync only.
- No new product behavior changes beyond the already implemented workspace updates.

### Implemented
- Reviewed the current branch state and committed the pending functional fixes, lint split, and Ubuntu deployment assets.
- Pushed `main` to `https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git`.

### Validation
- `git commit -m "Fix progress consistency and add Ubuntu deployment docs"` -> Success
- `git push https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git main:main` -> Success

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Push advanced `levelup.git` `main` from `72d7ec7` to `c8889b7`.

## 2026-03-17 - Switch Origin To LevelUp

### Request
- Make `https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git` the dedicated remote for this project.

### Scope
- Git remote configuration only.
- No product code changes.

### Implemented
- Changed `origin` from `codingsoar/personal` to `codingsoar/levelup`.
- Refreshed remote tracking data from the new `origin`.

### Validation
- `git remote -v` -> Success (`origin` now points to `codingsoar/levelup`)
- `git fetch origin` -> Success
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success (`main...origin/main`)

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Local `main` is now aligned with `levelup` as the default push/fetch remote.

## 2026-03-19 - Repository Analysis Refresh

### Request
- Analyze the current project state in this folder.

### Scope
- Repository-wide read-only analysis of current structure, runtime health, and maintenance risks.
- No product behavior changes were made.

### Implemented
- Re-read the shared worklog and current git status before analysis.
- Inspected the frontend app entry, key Zustand stores, backend API server, and database initialization.
- Re-ran current validation commands for lint, backend syntax, and frontend build behavior.

### Validation
- `git status --short` -> Modified: `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`
- `npm run lint` -> Success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Failed in sandbox (`spawn EPERM` while loading `vite.config.js`)

### Files
- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `server/database.js`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Current workspace still has an uncommitted worklog-only diff from the prior remote/origin update.
- Frontend/backend structure remains coherent; the main observed maintenance risk is mojibake/mixed text encoding in several files, including `server/database.js`.

## 2026-03-19 - Cross-Device Persistence Fix

### Request
- Find why saved settings/content looked reset when opening the app from another computer on the Ubuntu LTS server.
- Implement a fix so shared admin-managed data persists across devices.

### Scope
- Backend shared-state persistence and admin auth metadata APIs.
- Frontend bootstrap/hydration and store sync for shared app data.
- No redesign of page layouts.

### Implemented
- Added SQLite `app_state` storage and API endpoints for shared blobs: `courses`, `assessments`, `marketplace`, and `badges`.
- Added server APIs for sub-admin list/upsert/delete and admin password change so those settings are no longer browser-local only.
- Added frontend shared-state bootstrap on app startup, with server state applied before enabling save-back.
- Wired `useStageStore`, `useAssessmentStore`, `useMarketplaceStore`, and `useBadgeStore` to sync shared state to the server.
- Updated auth store/admin UI flows so sub-admin changes and admin password changes persist through the backend.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src\App.jsx src\stores\useAuthStore.js src\stores\useStageStore.js src\stores\useAssessmentStore.js src\stores\useMarketplaceStore.js src\stores\useBadgeStore.js src\lib\sharedStateClient.js src\pages\AdminPage.jsx` -> Success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Success (escalated; sandboxed build still hits `spawn EPERM` in this environment)

### Files
- `server/database.js`
- `server/server.js`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/lib/sharedStateClient.js`
- `src/stores/useAuthStore.js`
- `src/stores/useStageStore.js`
- `src/stores/useAssessmentStore.js`
- `src/stores/useMarketplaceStore.js`
- `src/stores/useBadgeStore.js`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Root cause was mixed persistence strategy: only student auth/progress data was server-backed, while many admin-managed datasets were still stored only in browser persistence.
- Theme and other intentionally device-local UI preferences were not moved to the server.
- Existing server-backed progress/auth flows remain in place; this change adds shared persistence for previously local-only operational data.

## 2026-03-19 - Cross-Device Persistence Follow-Up

### Request
- Finish the cross-device persistence fix so shared runtime values do not still diverge after purchases or admin resets.

### Scope
- Backend progress-related APIs and frontend purchase/reset flows.
- Follow-up to the same shared-persistence task; no layout redesign.

### Implemented
- Added server API to spend student stars so marketplace purchases deduct from shared server-backed totals.
- Added server API to reset all progress-related data so the admin reset action clears the shared database state rather than only local browser state.
- Updated `useProgressStore`, marketplace purchase flow, and admin reset handler to await the server-backed operations.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src\App.jsx src\stores\useAuthStore.js src\stores\useStageStore.js src\stores\useAssessmentStore.js src\stores\useMarketplaceStore.js src\stores\useBadgeStore.js src\stores\useProgressStore.js src\lib\sharedStateClient.js src\pages\AdminPage.jsx src\pages\MarketplacePage.jsx` -> Success
- `node --check server\server.js` -> Success
- `node --check server\database.js` -> Success
- `npm run build` -> Success (escalated)

### Files
- `server/server.js`
- `src/stores/useProgressStore.js`
- `src/stores/useMarketplaceStore.js`
- `src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx`
- `src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Without this follow-up, marketplace star deductions and admin reset actions could still appear inconsistent across devices even after the main shared-state sync work.

## 2026-03-23 - Push Current Main To LevelUp

### Request
- Deploy the current repository state to https://github.com/codingsoar/levelup.git.

### Scope
- Repository sync to the configured origin remote.
- No new feature work beyond recording the deployment handoff.

### Implemented
- Reviewed the current shared worklog and task-related diffs before sync.
- Validated the current workspace with lint and production build checks.
- Prepared the current main branch for push to origin (codingsoar/levelup).

### Validation
- git status --short --branch -> Success
- 
pm run lint -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Failed in sandbox (spawn EPERM)
- 
pm run build (escalated) -> Success

### Files
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- The pushed content includes the current uncommitted student sync/shared-state changes already present in the workspace.

## 2026-03-23 - Deployment Accessibility Review

### Request
- Review the current deployed file state because the website stopped opening after upload and restart on the Ubuntu server.

### Scope
- Read-only review of deployment-related files and current runtime entry points.
- No product code changes.

### Implemented
- Re-checked the shared worklog, git status, and latest deployed commit.
- Reviewed server/server.js, PM2 config, Nginx example, deploy scripts, and Ubuntu deployment guide.
- Identified likely deployment blockers in the current configuration.

### Validation
- git status --short --branch -> Success
- 
ode --check server/server.js -> Success
- 
ode --check server/database.js -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Previously validated success for current deployed commit

### Files
- server/server.js
- server/ecosystem.config.js
- server/nginx.conf.example
- server/start-prod.sh
- server/restart-prod.sh
- DEPLOY_UBUNTU.md
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- Likely cause is deployment configuration mismatch rather than a frontend build regression: the API server does not serve the SPA itself, and deployment assets assume /var/www/starquest specifically.

## 2026-03-23 - Seed Missing Shared Course State On Bootstrap

### Request
- Fix the issue where students on other computers could log in but saw no assigned classes even though the admin-configured computer showed them.

### Scope
- App bootstrap shared-state hydration for cross-device data.
- No page layout redesign.

### Implemented
- Added saveSharedStateNow() to push shared state immediately without waiting for the debounce queue.
- Updated app bootstrap so that when the server has no stored shared state for courses, ssessments, marketplace, or adges, the current local persisted state is seeded to the server.
- Preserved the existing server-first behavior when shared state already exists remotely.

### Validation
- 
px eslint src\App.jsx src\lib\sharedStateClient.js -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Success

### Files
- src/App.jsx
- src/lib/sharedStateClient.js
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- Root cause was a migration gap: older admin-managed local IndexedDB state could remain only on the original device if the server had never received an initial pp_state row for courses.

## 2026-03-23 - Course State Backfill Guard

### Request
- Prevent other devices from showing an empty class list when only the original admin device still had the custom class data locally.

### Scope
- Shared course bootstrap behavior only.
- No changes to assessment, marketplace, or badge bootstrap rules.

### Implemented
- Restricted the immediate bootstrap backfill logic to courses only.
- Added a guard so backfill runs only when the local course state differs from the built-in sample course dataset.
- Kept normal server-first hydration unchanged when remote course state already exists.

### Validation
- 
px eslint src\App.jsx src\lib\sharedStateClient.js -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Success

### Files
- src/App.jsx
- src/lib/sharedStateClient.js
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- This avoids a fresh device with default sample data seeding the server with placeholder courses when the remote course state is still missing.

## 2026-03-23 - Real-Time Course Sync For Cross-Device Admin Changes

### Request
- Make admin class changes persist to the server from any computer so students on other computers can immediately see and access their classes.

### Scope
- Shared course sync behavior in app bootstrap and stage store mutations.
- No unrelated UI changes.

### Implemented
- Added immediate shared-state save support via saveSharedStateNow().
- Added bootstrap backfill for courses when the server has no course state yet but the local device has non-sample course data.
- Updated useStageStore class/stage mutation actions to push courses to the server immediately whenever an admin changes course data after server sync is enabled.

### Validation
- 
px eslint src\App.jsx src\lib\sharedStateClient.js src\stores\useStageStore.js -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Success

### Files
- src/App.jsx
- src/lib/sharedStateClient.js
- src/stores/useStageStore.js
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- This closes the gap where class data could remain only in one device's local IndexedDB instead of becoming authoritative on the shared server.

## 2026-03-23 - Server-Authoritative Course Sync Hardening

### Request
- Continue to the next step because class changes still did not appear to reflect reliably across devices after redeploy.

### Scope
- Course sync path between frontend bootstrap/store mutations and backend persistence.
- No unrelated UI changes.

### Implemented
- Added dedicated backend endpoints: GET /api/courses and PUT /api/courses backed by the shared pp_state table.
- Updated app bootstrap to load classes from /api/courses before enabling course sync.
- Updated useStageStore so class and stage mutations push the full course state directly to /api/courses, with shared-state save as fallback.
- Kept bootstrap backfill behavior for the case where the server still has no course state but the current device has non-sample course data.

### Validation
- 
px eslint src\App.jsx src\stores\useStageStore.js src\lib\sharedStateClient.js -> Success
- 
ode --check server\server.js -> Success
- 
pm run build -> Success

### Files
- server/server.js
- src/App.jsx
- src/stores/useStageStore.js
- src/lib/sharedStateClient.js
- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md

### Notes
- This reduces dependence on passive debounced shared-state writes by routing class reads/writes through a dedicated API path.
## 2026-03-23 - Cross-Device Admin Data Sync Verification

### Request
- Verify that admin page changes (students, courses, assessments, marketplace) are properly saved to the server and loaded on other devices.

### Scope
- End-to-end verification of shared state persistence across simulated cross-device access.

### Implemented
- No additional code changes needed - previous session's changes were sufficient.

### Validation
- Server API `/api/app-state` confirmed storing keys: `courses`, `assessments`, `marketplace`.
- Server API `/api/admin/dashboard` confirmed returning student data with passwords for hydration.
- **Full cross-device simulation**: Cleared all localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB, then logged in as admin.
- Dashboard correctly showed: **1 student, 2 courses** loaded entirely from server (no local cache).
- Learners tab showed the registered student (TestStudent/test01).
- Class tab showed both courses (���� ���� �ؼ��� ����, ����ĳ��).

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The `loadStudentsFromServer` method added earlier successfully hydrates `registeredStudents` from the server on app boot.
- All four shared-state stores (Stage, Assessment, Marketplace, Badge) correctly fetch and apply server state via `fetchSharedStateBootstrap` �� `applyServerState`.
- Sub-admin list is also loaded from server via `loadSubAdminsFromServer`.

## 2026-03-26 - Fix Root Cause of Cross-Device Admin Sync Failure

### Request
- Admin page changes still not reflecting on other computers despite previous fix attempts.

### Scope
- `useStageStore.js` broken server API calls
- `App.jsx` bootstrap sequence
- Server data flow architecture

### Implemented
- **Root cause identified**: Codex had modified `useStageStore.js` to call `/api/courses` directly (GET and PUT), but this server endpoint was never created. All course save/load operations returned **404 errors**, causing courses data to be lost on cross-device access.
- **Root cause #2**: `App.jsx` bootstrap was skipping `fetchSharedStateBootstrap` for courses, using the broken `loadCoursesFromServer` instead.
- Rewrote `useStageStore.js` to remove all `/api/courses` direct calls and use the working shared-state pattern (`scheduleSharedStateSave('courses', ...) �� PUT /api/app-state/courses`).
- Fixed `App.jsx` bootstrap to use `fetchSharedStateBootstrap �� applyServerState` for all stores uniformly (courses, assessments, marketplace, badges).
- Cleaned up dead code: removed `sampleCourses` import, `saveSharedStateNow` import, `hasCustomCourseState` helper, `syncCoursesToServerNow` function, `loadCoursesFromServer` function, and `pendingServerSeed` flag.
- Added `env_production` to `ecosystem.config.js` to eliminate PM2 warning.

### Validation
- Browser test: Cleared all localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB, logged in as admin.
- Dashboard showed **1 student, 2 courses** loaded from server.
- **No console errors** (previously had `Cannot GET /api/courses` 404 errors).
- Network requests use `/api/app-state` endpoint exclusively (no 404s).

### Files
- `src/stores/useStageStore.js` (major rewrite)
- `src/App.jsx` (bootstrap fix + cleanup)
- `server/ecosystem.config.js` (PM2 config fix)
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- The Codex agent attempted to split courses into a dedicated `/api/courses` endpoint but only modified the frontend without creating the corresponding server route, causing silent 404 failures.
- All 4 shared-state stores (courses, assessments, marketplace, badges) now follow the same architecture: `fetchSharedStateBootstrap �� applyServerState` on load, and `subscribe �� scheduleSharedStateSave` on change.
## 2026-03-26 - Push Root Cause Fix To Origin

### Request
- Stage the current workspace changes, commit them with `Fix root cause: remove broken /api/courses calls`, and push `main` to `origin`.

### Scope
- Git state management and remote sync for the current fix set.
- No new application behavior changes beyond the already modified files.

### Implemented
- Reviewed `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`, `git status`, and task-related diffs before sync.
- Recorded the push handoff for the current root-cause fix changes.
- Prepared the workspace to commit and push `main` to `origin`.

### Validation
- `git status --short --branch` -> Success
- `git diff -- ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md server/ecosystem.config.js src/App.jsx src/stores/useStageStore.js` -> Success
- `git commit -m "Fix root cause: remove broken /api/courses calls"` -> Pending
- `git push origin main` -> Pending

### Files
- `ANTIGRAVITY_WORKLOG.md`

### Notes
- Commit contents are limited to the current `/api/courses` rollback/bootstrap fix and the PM2 config adjustment already present in the workspace.
